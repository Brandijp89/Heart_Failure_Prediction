## Heart Failure Prediction with Machine Learning 🩺

This project applies machine learning to predict mortality risk in heart failure patients based on clinical features like age, ejection fraction, and serum creatinine. It demonstrates an end-to-end pipeline from preprocessing to model evaluation.

### 🔧 Tools & Libraries
Python · Jupyter Notebook · Scikit-learn · Matplotlib · Seaborn

### 🧠 Project Steps
- Applied supervised learning algorithms (Logistic Regression, Gradient Boosting) on labeled clinical data.
- Conducted preprocessing: normalization, feature selection, and imputation.
- Evaluated models using accuracy, confusion matrix, ROC-AUC, and cross-validation.
- Visualized feature importance and key indicators to enhance interpretability.
- Supported early clinical decision-making by modeling mortality risk.
